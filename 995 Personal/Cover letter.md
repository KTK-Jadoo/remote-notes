ear Hiring Manager,

  

I’m writing to express my interest in any data science or machine learning opportunities that align with my experience and interests. As an international student from Agra, India, currently pursuing a B.A. in Data Science at UC Berkeley, I bring a unique combination of persistence, global perspective, and practical technical experience that I believe will make me a valuable contributor to your team.

  

I’ve been fortunate to work across impactful domains—from building internal data tools at Seva Foundation that help improve global vision health, to developing a 3D pose-analysis fitness app that provides personalized feedback. I’ve also engineered NLP systems like _Steam-lit_, a game recommender powered by BERT and LDA, and _ScribbleAI_, which gained recognition on Product Hunt and won an OpenAI Hackathon. These projects weren’t just technical exercises—they were lessons in product thinking, user empathy, and performance at scale.

  

I’ve navigated many systems alone—applying to international schools from a small city in India, supporting myself at Berkeley through merit-based scholarships, and learning how to contribute meaningfully in spaces where I was often the only outsider. I’ve had to be resourceful, independent, and relentless in both academics and life.

  

If given the chance, I hope to bring the same energy, curiosity, and impact to your team. I am open to internships or full-time new grad roles in data science, machine learning, or applied AI.

  

Thank you for considering my application. I would love the opportunity to speak further.

  

Sincerely,

**Kartikeya Sharma**
